# Smart Gym trainer

 
 
A Smart Yoga training application developed with flutter.
The application performs **Pose Estimation** using pretrained tfLite Posenet model and then gives a percentage score for its correctness.
All the processing is done on device and no internet connection is required.


The application is a part of a team project for our Software Development course. [Vishad Kanathia][1],[Vidhu Joshi][2],[Usman Khalid][3] & myself created the application using Flutter

The user gets an interface to choose from a list of yoga poses. After the pose is selected, the live user's pose is detected and ranked correspondingly.
